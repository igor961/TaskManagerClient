# task-manager-client

This is a web-client for an TaskManager app

##Some tips for things that might not be intuitively clear right away:
- To edit a project - to pick up a new name - after clicking on an editing button set cursor to project's name (there is no modal windows for it)
- After changing priorities of tasks you have to push a small red button under the project (that will appear) to send new priorities on a server
